    "\n",
    "4shanks_plot_layout.mat contains a fieldtrip-style 'lay' structure. This structure is helpful in plotting the individual electrodes in their spatial organization. That is, it can be used to plot each electrode in a nice spatial configuration with shank electrode outlines surrounding them. Much more robust than using subplots, and using the syntax far below you have more direct control of how your small plots look. \n",
